# pokebadge
Thingy that generates images that we want


The basic idea is to make a HTTP endpoint, that given a credly account name generates an image consisting of a background from pokemon showing badges under a vest and overlaying badges from credly.

Additional ideas posted in Issues.


## How to run

Fill in Credly username in line 19 in cmd/api/main.go

Result file will show up in repo root directory.
